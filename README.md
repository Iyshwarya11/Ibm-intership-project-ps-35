Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using Machine Learning and IBM Cloud Lite
📖 Overview
This project implements a robust Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using machine learning, based on a public intrusion detection dataset. The goal is to analyze network traffic and identify various cyber-attacks (DoS, Probe, R2L, U2R) as well as normal activity. The solution leverages IBM Cloud Lite services for model development and scalable deployment.

🚩 Problem Statement
Modern networks are highly vulnerable to attacks such as:

Denial of Service (DoS)

Probing/Scanning (Probe)

Remote to Local (R2L)

User to Root (U2R)

Swift detection of these threats is critical to protect users and infrastructure. Manual monitoring is impractical at scale. This project aims to develop an automated, ML-based system to accurately classify network traffic and support proactive defense.

💡 Proposed Solution
Data Collection: kaggle.com/datasets/sampadab17/networkintrusion-detection

Preprocessing: Cleanses data, encodes features, and normalizes inputs.

Model Training: Uses Random Forest/AutoAI with IBM Watson Studio.

Deployment: Deploys ML model as an API on IBM Cloud via Watson Machine Learning.

Evaluation: Measures detection performance with classification metrics (accuracy, F1, etc.).

🛠️ Technology Stack
Cloud: IBM Cloud Lite, IBM Watson Studio, Watson Machine Learning, Cloud Object Storage

Languages: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, joblib, matplotlib/seaborn, ibm-watson-machine-learning

ML Approach: Random Forest/AutoAI (multi-class classification)

API: REST (for real-time/batch inference)
